1. Bring questions about git to class on Wednesday.
1. Make sure that the `gh` CLI tool works by using it to create an issue called test on your kwl repo with `gh issue create`
2. Read sections 1.1,1.2, and 1.3 of the [pro git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control) this is mostly review at this point, but we are going to go into more of how git works next, so you need to make sure these concepts are all sorted out. Comment on your prepare issue if reading helped clarify confusion, made you more confused, or gave you new understanding.  Either explain what you learned or ask a question you have. Tag @brownsarahm on the issue.
