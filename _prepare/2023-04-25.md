1. (optional, get a head start on the final review/practice badges) Bring 2 multiple choice questions about computer systems, machine representation, or building code to class. 
2. (optional, community badge opportunity) Try out the Pycharm extenstion created by one of your classmates as a build badge. You can download it by searching "gcc integration" in pycharm directly in the plugin marketplace or by [following the  instructions on the documentation website](https://mike-fmh.github.io/gcc-integration/#installation). If you succeed comment on your prepare issue and tag Professor Brown with which technique (pluging marketpalce or manual) you used to install it.  If it does not work, open an [issue](https://github.com/mike-fmh/gcc-integration/issues) that describes what you did, what happened, and what you expected instead.
