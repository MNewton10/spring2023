1. Start recording notes on _how_ you use IDEs for the next couple of weeks using the template file in the course notes (will provide prompts and tips). We will come back to these notes in class later, but it is best to record over a time period instead of trying to remember at that time. Store your notes in your kwl repo in {index}`idethoughts.md` on an `ide_prep` branch. **This is prep for the week after spring break, it does not have to be in the Feb 28 Experience Badge.** 
1. make sure that you have a `test` git repo that matches the notes. **this is very important and if you do not have it you will not be able to follow along in class on Feb 28**

# IDE Thoughts

## Actions Accomplished
<!-- list what things you do: run code/ edit code/ create new files/ etc; no need to comment on what the code you write does -->


## Features Used
<!-- list features of it that you use, like a file explorer, debugger, etc -->
