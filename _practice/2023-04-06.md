1. Add {index}`bitwise.md` to your kwl and write the bitwise operations required for the following transformations:
    ```
    4 -> 128
    12493 - > -12494
    127 -> 15
    7 -> 56
    4 -> -5
    ```
2. For the following figure out the bitwise operator:
    ```
    45 (_) 37 = 37
    45 (_) 37 = 45
    3 (_) 5 = 7
    6 (_) 8 = 0
    10 (_) 5 = 15
    ```
3. Create {index}`readingbytes.md` and answer the following:
    ```
    - if a file had the following binary contents, what would it display in the terminal? Describe how you can figure this out manually and check it using C or Python. '01110011011110010111001101110100011001010110110101110011'
    - What is the contents of the `sample.bn` if ther reesult of`cat sample.bn` is: ` ¢¶"*`
    ```
4. Read about integer overflow and describe what it is, use an example assuming an 8 bit system, and  how integer overflow is handled in Python, C, Javascript, and one other language of your choice in {index}`overflow_languages.md` 
5. Contribute a new, not previously posted, use of bitwise operators to [the discussion](https://github.com/introcompsys/sp23community/discussions/8)
