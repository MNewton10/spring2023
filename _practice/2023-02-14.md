1. Read today's notes when they are posted.
2. Add to your {index}`software.md` a section about if that project does or does not adhere to the unix philosophy and why. 
3. create {index}`methods.md` and answer the following:

```
- which of the three methods for studying a system do you use most often when debugging? 
- which do you use when you are trying to understand something new? 
- do you think the ones you use most often are consistently the effective? why or why not? When do they work or not work? 
- what are you most interested in trying that might be different?
```
