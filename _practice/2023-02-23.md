1. Review the notes
2. Read about [git internals](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-Objects) to review what we did in class in greater detail. Make {index}`gitplumbingdetail.md`. Create a visualization that is compatible with version control (eg can be viewed in plain text and compared line by line, such as table or mermaid graph) that shows the relationship between at least three porcelain commands and their corresponding plumbing commands. 
3. Create {index}`gitislike.md` and explain main git operations we have seen (add, commit, push) in your own words in a way that will either help you remember or how you would explain it to someone else at a high level. This might be analogies or explanations using other programming concepts or concepts from a hobby. 
1. Contribute to your group repo and review a classmateâ€™s contribution. Include a link to your contribution and review in your badge PR comment using markdown link syntax. (view the raw version of this issue page for the git internals link above for an example)
