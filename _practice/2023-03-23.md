1. Explore the IDE you use most and add `frequentide.md` to your kwl with notes about which features it does/not have based on what you learned in the in-class activity. 
2. Compare at least 3 IDEs for working in a single language. Your comparison should be based on first hand experience using each of the IDEs. Complete the same task in each tool. Create `favoriteide.md` to define and justify your preferred IDE. Include a ranked list of your criteria(which attributes and features) with justification/explanation of your ranking of these criteria. Then describe how each of the three IDEs meets/does not meet those criteria, and a conclusion of which IDE is the best based on your criteria.
