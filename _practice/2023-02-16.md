1. Make your kwl repo into a jupyter book. Review the notes carefully for what files are required to make `jupyter-book build` run. Ignore your build directory. 
2. Add one of the following features to your kwl repo: 
    - a [glossary](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/content/content-blocks.html?highlight=glossary#glossaries) both the terms and linknig to their use
    - [substitutions](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/content/content-blocks.html?highlight=substitutions#substitutions-and-variables-in-markdown)
    - [figure](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/content/figures.html#figures)
3. Learn about the documentation ecosystem in another language that you know. In `docs.md` include a summary of your findings and compare and contrast it to jupyter book/sphinx.  Include a [bibliography](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/content/citations.html) of the sources you used. You can use [this generator](https://url-to-bibtex.vercel.app/) for informal sources and [google scholar](https://digitalmeasures.oregonstate.edu/training/export-bibtex-google-scholar) for formal sources.
