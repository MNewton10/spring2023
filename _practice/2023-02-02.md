1. Download the course website and your group repo via terminal. Try these on different days to get "spaced repetition" and help remember better. Each time you do, append the commands used to a {index}`terminalwork.md`  
1. Explore the difference between git add and git commit: try committing and pushing without adding, then add and push without committing. Describe what happens in each case in your {index}`gitcommit.md`. Compare what happens based on what you can see on GitHub and what you can see with git status.
