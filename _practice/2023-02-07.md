1. Read today's notes
1. Update your KWL chart with the new items and any learned items.
2. Learn about [GitHub forks](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks) (you can also use other resources)
3. add `branches-forks.md` to your KWL repo and describe how branches work, what a fork is and how they relate to one another. If you use other resources, include them in your file.
