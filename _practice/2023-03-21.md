1. File permissions are represented numerically often in octal, by transforming the permissions for each level (owner, group, all) as binary into a number. Add {index}`octal-practice.md` to your KWL repo and answer the following.
    ```
    1. Transform the permissions [`r--`, `rw-`, `rwx`] to octal, by treating it as three bits.
    1. Transform the permission we changed our script to `rwxr-xr-x` to octal.
    1. What permissions would we want (both long and in octal) would allow only the owner to run a file?
    1. Which of the following would prevent a file from being edited by other people 777 or 755?
    ```
2. create a `midterm.md` file in your kwl repo with 10 mutliple choice questions that cover topics from at least 5 different class sessions. Each question should have 4 options, 1 correct and 3 that represent a reasonable, but incorrect idea someone may have. All 10 questions should check understanding of key *concepts*, not only terminology or the name of a command. For each option explain why it is/not correct in a way that would help clarify someone's confusion if they had picked that answer instead of the correct answer. Use the following syntax: 
```
