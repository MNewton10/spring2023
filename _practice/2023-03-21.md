1. create a `midterm.md` file with 15 mutliple choice questions that cover topics from at least 5 different class sessions. Each question should have 4 options, 1 correct and 3 that represent a reasonable, but incorrect idea someone may have. At least 10 questions should check understanding of key *concepts*, not only terminology (a maximum of 5 questions can check terminology only). For each option explain why it is/not correct in a way that would help clarify someone's confusion if they had picked that answer instead of the correct answer. Use the following syntax: 
```
Question text 

- [ ] a wrong answer

- [ ] another wong

---
