## Questions After Today's Class 

### How does the computer hold the information for my github account after I shut it off?
It stores your account information in files on your system. 

### How does the terminal know that our upstream server is github? 

We cloned the repo from github. This can also be configured manually.  We can even add more then one available remote in a single repo.  Each branch will have a specific, single upstream, but two branches in the same repo can have different upstreams. 

### Could I have edited my experience reflection in terminal if I wanted?

Yes! 

### What is the best way to get comfortible with the terminal?

Lots of practice. Start with the recently posted badges, they're designed to give you good practice. 

### What is a .md file?

[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)

### Are there any disadvantages to using nano as opposed to something like VIM?

nano only has simple features. For simple tasks, there's no disadvantage.  For complex tasks it would likely be more laborious. 

### Is there going to be somewhere we can see all of git hubs syntax for the terminal?

I passed out a printed [cheatsheet from GitHub](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf) with a good amount of the sytax. If you did not get one, let me know. 

### If I close the terminal is everything we did saved?

Yes, everything we did today in the terminal was directly manipulating files. The log of what commands we ran is even likely saved, but not necessarily in an easy to find and use file.  

### Is it possible for me to perform everything that I need to with git through the terminal?

git is a command line tool, by defition. The git program is **only** available on the terminal.  Other programs like GitHub Desktop or VSCode can do git operations, but typically only a subset.  There is also only a subset of git operations available on GitHub.com. 

There are however, some GitHub things that there is no command line tool for. 

### How do I create different versions of my code on GitHub?

branches!

### Is `origin` the name used by git terminal to reference github's servers?

In our repos we have seen so far origin has always poointed to a specific repo on GitHub.  `origin` is just the default name, so, there could be no `origin` and the repo still have the `remote` be a GitHub repo.  

We will see soon that we can work with multiple remotes, for example with a GitHub fork.  In that case, there would be two different remotes tht each point to a GitHub repo. 

### How to commit multiple files at once?

add more than one file to the staging area before commiting. 

### Is there a way to work with other things (issues, actions, etc) in the terminal?

For GitHub, yes!
