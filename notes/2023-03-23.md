# What is an IDE?  


## Review your notes



```{important}
Do this before proceeding to the next section
```



Either discuss with peers in class or on the GitHub (asynch) discuss commonalities in your IDE notes.



### In person



1. What different tasks did all of you use an IDE for?
1. What features of an IDE did you all use?
1. Which features were used but not very much?
1. Share the most helpful IDE feature you use?



Update your individual IDE notes with 1-2 things you learned from your peers.




### On GitHub



There are questions on the [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/introcompsys/sp23community/discussions/4). Update your individual IDE notes in your KWL repo with links to your post and replies.

### In person
In class with your peers you can divide these up and read one and then share key points with others.



With your group, build a large list of IDE attributes or features that would be important, and make a table of how would you evaluate attribute?  Which ones would you evaluate by just if it exists or not?  Which ones would you evaluate in different degrees, what attributes of them would you evaluate?


Discuss with your group how you would rank them.  You do not all have to agree on a final ranking, but notice the differences.




[vs code is open source](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/)


Summarize what you all discussed [on GitHub](https://github.com/introcompsys/sp23community/discussions/5) for your classmates.  Note the ranking, with any disagreements. 

### Asynchronous



After reading the above, also read at least 3 different articles about the "best IDE" for your favorite language or for multiple languages.  

Notice what  IDE attributes or features the authors think is important, and how they evaluate each criterion. Which ones are evaluted as present/missing?  Which ones are evaluated in more detail. 

Join the discussion on [GitHub](https://github.com/introcompsys/sp23community/discussions/5) summarizing what you found the most important criteria to be and if you personally agree or not.
