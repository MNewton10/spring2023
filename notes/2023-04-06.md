We're going to use the test cases from the book's project 5:

1. Load Program
1. Navigate to nand2tetris/projects/05

We're not going to *do* project 5, which is to build a CPU, but instead to use the test.

For more on how the emulator works see the [CPU Emulator Tutorial](https://www.nand2tetris.org/_files/ugd/44046b_24b3a15aa628404fbf6dacd86d7da3af.pdf).

For much more detail about how this all works [chapter 4](https://www.nand2tetris.org/_files/ugd/44046b_d70026d8c1424487a451eaba3e372132.pdf) of the related text book has description of the machine code and assembly language.


## How does the computer actually add constants?

We'll use `add.hack` first.  

This program adds constants, 2+3.  

It is a program, assembly code that we are loading to the simulator's ROM, which is memory that gets read only by the CPU.  

Run the simulator and watch what each line of the program does.  

Notice the following:
- to compute with a constant, that number only exists in ROM in the instructions
- to write a value to memory the address register first has to be pointed to what where in the memory the value will go, then the value can be sent there


The simulator has a few key parts:
- address register
- program counter

If you prefer to read, see [section 5.2.1- 5.2.6 of nan2tetris book](https://www.nand2tetris.org/_files/ugd/44046b_b2cad2eea33847869b86c541683551a7.pdf)

- This program the first instruction puts 2 in the address register from the instructions in ROM.  
- Then it moves the 2 through the ALU to the data register (D)
- then it puts 3 on the address register
- then it adds the numbers at D and A
- then it puts 0 on the address register
- then it write the output from the ALU (D) to memory (at the location indicated by the A register)

```{admonition} Explore Badge Idea

Create some experiments in the simulator and write new programs.  Here are some ideas, but you can try anything you are curious about. 
- What line do you change to change where it outputs the data?
- How could you add a third number?
- How could you add two pairs, saving the intermediate numbers?
- How could you do (4+4)*(3+2)?
```




## Machine Representation 

```
python
```


## Prelude: REPL

One way we can use many interpreted languages, including Python is to treat the interpreter like an application and then interact with it in the terminal.  

This is called the Read, Execute, Print Loop or REPL.

We can execute simple expressions like mathemeatical expressions:

```Python
Python 3.8.3 (default, Jul  2 2020, 11:26:31) 
[Clang 10.0.0 ] :: Anaconda, Inc. on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> 2+3
```

and it will print the result
```
5
```

We can create variables
```Python
>>> name =   'sarah'
```

but assignment does not return anything, so nothing is printed.

We can see the value of a variable, by typing its name
```Python
>>> name
```

```
'sarah'
```


## Characters to Integers


Python provides a builtin function [`ord`](https://docs.python.org/3.10/library/functions.html?highlight=ord#ord) to find the Unicode key for that character.

````{margin}
```{tip}
This structure, the `[]` is called a list comprehension. It
executes a `for` loop in order to build a `list`.  In the REPL,
it will then print out the list.
```
````

```Python
>>> ord('s')
115
>>> [ord(char) for char in name]
[115, 97, 114, 97, 104]
```


Note that it's important to try multiple things if you aren't sure the format you are getting back or to check the official documents, as Denno found by testing this with his name in lowercase.

```
>>> name ='denno'
>>> [ord(char) for char in name]
[100, 101, 110, 110, 111]
```


Coincidentally, the letters in his name all fall into the hundreds and only require 0 and 1 in decimal, so it looks like they could be 3 bit binary numbers.

 ## Why is the object file not human readable?  




The object file displays as random weird characters because it is written to disk in a different format than our terminal reads it in.
It is the specific instructions (from the assembly) and memory addresses written to a file in binary.
Our terminal reads it one byte (8bits) at a time and interprets those as characters.

Today, we will see how characters are represented as integers, then binary, and read and write files in binary of strings we know to see how it what happens and mimic something like how that object file happened by writing as binary and then reading it as characters.  


Python also allows us to change content into a byte array:
```Python
>>> bytearray(34)
bytearray(b'\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00')
```

We can also apply this to a whole string worth of integers

```Python
>>> name_ints = [ord(char) for char in name]
>>> name_ints
[115, 97, 114, 97, 104]
```


We can then write this to a file, by getting the actual byes of each item.
First, we will save our list in a variable.

We will use the Python `with` keyword to open the file so that we do not to need to separately open and close the file.
in the `open` function, the first parameter is the file name and the second is the mode.  In this case, we want to write ('w') in binary ('b'). `f` is the filestream.


```Python
>>> with open('name.txt','wb') as f:
...   f.write(bytes(bytearray(name_ints))
... 
... 
... 
... 
... 
KeyboardInterrupt
```
I forgot the final closing `)` but did not see my own error, so I used crt+c to quit and get a fresh start. 

```Python
>>> with open('name.txt','wb') as f:
...   f.write(bytes(bytearray(name_ints)))
... 
```

it returns 5 in this case, because it wrote out 5 bytes, one per character.
```
5
```

```Python
>>> name_ints = [ord(char) for char in 'asldfkaslfjs']
>>> with open('name.txt','wb') as f:
...   f.write(bytes(bytearray(name_ints)))
...
```

with more characters, more bytes
```
12
```

```Python
>>> name_ints = [ord(char) for char in name]
>>> with open('name.txt','wb') as f:
...   f.write(bytes(bytearray(name_ints)))
... 
```

```
5
```

```Python
>>> exit()
```

If we exit python we can look at the file and see how it is interpreted.


Remember we wrote, as binary, the numbers, `115, 97, 114, 97, 104` to the file
```
cat name.txt
```
but it is interpretted as the string  by the terminal.

```
```
sarah
```

Back in python


```
python
```

Back in Python, we can read the file as binary or as regular, first reading it as a string, we  et the char characters
```Python
Python 3.8.3 (default, Jul  2 2020, 11:26:31) 
[Clang 10.0.0 ] :: Anaconda, Inc. on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> with open('name.txt','r') as f:
...    print(f.read())
... 
```

```
sarah
```

```Python
>>> with open('name.txt','r') as f:
...    name_in  = f.read()
... 
>>> type(name_in)
<class 'str'>
```

by checking the type we can confirm by defualt it reads the bytes in and finds a string. 

We can use `rb` as the mode to read it as binary
```Python
>>> with open('name.txt','rb') as f:
...    name_in_bin  = f.read()
... 
```

```
>>> type(name_in_bin)
<class 'bytes'>
```

This is binary, but the python interpreter also *prints* it as a string, the `b` indicates the object is actually binary type.


## Bit level Operations

We can operate on integers bit by bit.

If we shift 3 one to the right we transform from `11` to `1`, we can use the `>>` operator to do this.

```Python
>>> 3 >> 1
```

```
1
```

We can shift it the other way too: `11` to `110` so we get from 3 to 6

```Python
>>> 3<< 1
```

```
6
```

We can also use logical operators
```
>>> 1 & 0 
```

```
0
```

```
>>> 7 & 15
```

```
7
```

But these do not work for non integer values. We will look at how these work next class and see why. 
```
>>> 3.4 & 4.5
```

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for &: 'float' and 'float'
```

This is exclusive or, or xor, where it is only a 1 if exactly one bit of the inputs is a one.  For the same number it will always be a zero

```
>>> 3^3
```

```
0
```
````{admonition} inplace swap
you can use xor to inplace swap two values, instead of using a temp variable
````

The `|` does or

```
>>> 3 | 1
```

```
3
```

```
>>> 3|6
```

```
7
```
The `~` does negate. 
```
>>> ~4
```

```
-5
>>> exit()
```
