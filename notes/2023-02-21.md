### Progress

- find an issue from me on your KWL repo with titled "progress as of 2023-02-18 HH:MM:SS" ask questions there. 
- merge PR from me titled "udpate experience report action"

```{important}
read comments carefully, if we correct something for you a few times and you continue to frequently make the same error, we will stop approving work with that error**

The bottom of the page may still have rendering issues, if there are not diagrams, see prismia for notes. 



CDN for `mermaid.js` as imported through the [sphinx extension]() that allows the jupyter book (course website) to render mermaid diagrams is failing. I put in an [issue](https://github.com/mgaitan/sphinxcontrib-mermaid/issues/110) to report the bug.  After class, I also figured out how to fix it and 
submitted a [PR](https://github.com/mgaitan/sphinxcontrib-mermaid/pull/111) as well. I tested the jupyter book build offline with the version of the package I edited, and it works. So, I have attempted making [my fork version of the package](https://github.com/brownsarahm/sphinxcontrib-mermaid/tree/cdnupdate) the version that GitHub installs.

## Git is a File system

+++

```{important}
[git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) is the official reference on git.

+++

this includes other spoken languages as well if that is helpful for you.
```

+++

[git is fundamentally a content-addressable filesystem with a VCS user interface written on top of it.](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Plumbing-and-Porcelain)

+++

Content-addressable filesystem means a key-value data store.

+++


```{dropdown} what types of programming have you seen that use key- value pairs?
- python dictionaries
- pointers (address,content)
- parameter, passed values
```



```
Python 3.8.3 (default, Jul  2 2020, 11:26:31) 
[Clang 10.0.0 ] :: Anaconda, Inc. on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> md = {'key1':1}
>>> md[key1]
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'key1' is not defined
>>> md['key1']
1
>>> exit()
```
What this means is that you can insert any kind of content into a Git repository, for which Git will hand you back a unique key you can use later to retrieve that content.


## Git is a Version Control System

+++

git stores **snapshots** of your work each time you commit.

+++

![snapshot of 5 version sof 3 files](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/images/snapshots.png)

+++

it uses 3 stages:

+++

![3 stages in git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/images/areas.png)

+++



## Git has two sets of commands

+++

Porcelain: the user friendly VCS

+++

Plumbing: the internal workings- a toolkit for a VCS

+++


We have so far used git as a version control system.  A version control system, in general, will have operations like commit, push, pull, clone.  These may work differently under the hood or be called different things, but those are what something needs to have in order to keep track of different versions.

+++

The plumbing commands reveal the *way* that git performs version control operations.  This means, they implement file system operations for the git version control system.  

+++

You can think of the plumbing vs porcelain commands like public/private methods.  As a user, you only need the public methods (porcelain commands) but those use the private ones to get things done (plumbing commands).  We will use the plumbing commands over the next few classes to examine what git *really* does when we call the porcelain commands that we will typically use.  


## Git is distributed

+++

What does that mean?  

+++

Git runs locally.  It can run in many places, and has commands to help sync across remotes, but git does not require one copy of the repository to be the "official" copy and the others to be subordinate.  git just sees repositories.

+++

For human reasons, we like to have one "official" copy and treat the others as local copies, but that is a social choice, not a technological requirement of git. Even though we will typically use it with an offical copy and other copies, having a tool tht does not care, makes the tool more flexible and allows us to create workflows, or networks of copies that have any relationship we want.

+++


It's about the workflows, or the ways we socially *use* the tool.

## *How does git do all these things?*
Let's look at git again in our `github-inclass` repo

```
cd ../github-in-class-brownsarahm-1/
```

We can use the bash command `find` to search the file *system* note that this does not search the **contents** of the files, just the names.
```
find objects/ -type f
```

```

```

This is a lot of files! It's more than we have in our working directory. 
```
cd ..
ls
```

```
API.md			docs
CONTRIBUTING.md		greeting.md
LICENSE.md		helper_functions.py
README.md		important_classes.py
about.md		setup.py
abstract_base_class.py	tests
alternative_classes.py
```

This is a consequence of git taking snap shots and tracking both the actual contents of our working directory **and** our commit messages and other meta data about each commit. 

## Git HEAD

First lets get a a clean working directory 

```{note}
MY first `git status` was not a clearn up to date working tree.  I took the steps to get there
```

```
git status
```

```
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

the program `git` does not run continously the entire time you are using it for a project.  It runs quick commands each time you tell it to, it's goal is to manage files, so this makes sense.  This also means that important information that `git` needs is also saved in files.  

```
cd .git
ls
```

```
COMMIT_EDITMSG	ORIG_HEAD	description	info		packed-refs
FETCH_HEAD	REBASE_HEAD	hooks		logs		refs
HEAD		config		index		objects
```

the files in all caps are like gits variables. Lets look at the one called `HEAD` we have intereacted with `HEAD` before when resolving merge conflicts. 


```
cat HEAD 
```

```
ref: refs/heads/main
```

`HEAD` is a pointer to the currently checked out branch. 


```
git status
```

```
fatal: this operation must be run in a work tree
```
Inside the `.git` directory `git` commands do not work.

```
cd ..
```

```
```


```
git status
```

```
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

that matches the `HEAD` as expected.  Lets swithc and look agian. 

```
git checkout 2-create-an-about-file
```

```
Switched to branch '2-create-an-about-file'
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/2-create-an-about-file'.
```


```
git status
```

```
On branch 2-create-an-about-file
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/2-create-an-about-file'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```


```
cat .git/HEAD 
```

```
ref: refs/heads/2-create-an-about-file
```

As expected. 

## Branches are pointers

```
cat .git/refs/heads/2-create-an-about-file 
```

```
