# Bash Scripting 

So far we have used bash commands to navigate our file system as a way to learn about the file system itself. To do this we used commands like:
- `mv`
- `cd`
- `pwd`
- `ls` 

Bash is a unix shell for the GNU operating system and it has been adopted in other contexts as well.  It is the default shell on Ubuntu linux as well for example (and many others). This is why we teach it. 

A Unix shell is both a command interpreter and a programming language. As a command interpreter, the shell provides the user interface to the rich set of GNU utilities. The programming language features allow these utilities to be combined. 


Read the official definition of `bash` and a shell in [the bash manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#Introduction)



Today we will start from the main course directory

```
cd systems
ls
```

```
example				test
github-in-class-brownsarahm-1	testobj.md
kwl				tiny-book
```

## Variables in Bash

We can create variables
```
NAME='Sarah'
```

```{important}
notice that there are **no spaces** around the `=`. spaces in bash separate commands and options, so they cannot be in variable declarations.  
```

and use them with a `$` before the variable name. 
```
echo $NAME
```

```
Sarah
```

This variable is local, in memory, to the current terminal window, so if we open a separate window and try `echo $NAME` it will not work. We can also see that it does not create any file changes. 

```
ls
```

```
example				test
github-in-class-brownsarahm-1	testobj.md
kwl				tiny-book
```

We can, however use the variable at differnt working directories. So if we move

```
cd github-in-class-brownsarahm-1/
echo $NAME
```

```
Sarah
```

it still works. 

The `$` is essential syntax for recalling variables in bash. If we forget it, it treats it as a literal

```
echo NAME
```

```
NAME
```
so we get the variable **name** out instead of the varialbe **value**

A common mistake is to put a space around the `=` sign, this is actually considered **good style** in many other languages. 

```
:class: cell_input
NAME ='Sarah'
```

```
:class: cell_output
bash: NAME: command not found
```
In bash, however, this creates an error.  When there is a space after `NAME`, `bash` tried to interpet `NAME` as a bash command, but then it does not find it, so it gives an error. 

Removing the space works again: 
```
NAME='Sarah'
```

```
```


## Bash Loops

We can also make loops: 

```
for name in Sarah Amoy Scott Bri
> do
> echo $name
> done
```
A few important things, to make note of:
- loop variable does not need to be an iterator.  the loop variable here `name` takes each value from a list (`Sarah Amoy Scott Bri`)
- lists is bash are defined with no brackets and no commas `Sarah Amoy Scott Bri` is a list
- we start the loop body with `do` and close it with `done` these are like the `{` and `}` in some langauges. 

```
Sarah
Amoy
Scott
Bri
```

When we get the command back with the up arrow key, it puts it all on one line, because it was one command.  The `;` (semicolon) separates the "lines"

```
for name in Sarah Amoy Scott Bri Aiden; do echo $name; done
```

```
Sarah
Amoy
Scott
Bri
Aiden
```


```
ls
```

```
API.md			about.md		helper_functions.py
CONTRIBUTING.md		abstract_base_class.py	important_classes.py
LICENSE.md		alternative_classes.py	setup.py
README.md		docs			tests
```

## Nesting commands

We can run a command to generate the list:

```
for file in $(ls)
> do 
> echo $file
> done
API.md
CONTRIBUTING.md
LICENSE.md
README.md
about.md
abstract_base_class.py
alternative_classes.py
docs
helper_functions.py
important_classes.py
setup.py
tests
```

the `$()` tells bash to run that command first and then hold its output as a variable for use elsewhere
```{important}
I use this to make the date in the filename of your experience reports and the titles of your badge issues
```

```{admonition} Find & Comment
:class: community, dropdown
find where I use this in one of your action files and add a comment explaining the line. Put this commit in its own PR and request a review from @brownsarahm for a community badge! 
``` 

We can modify what is in the `$()`: 
```
for file in $(ls -a); do  echo $file; done
```

```

tests
```

## Conditionals in bash

We can also do conditional statements
```
if test -f docs
> then
> echo "file"
> fi 
```

the key parts of this: 
- `test` checks if a file or directory exists
- the `-f` option makes it check if the item is a *file*
- what to do if the condition is met goes after a `then` keyword
- the `fi` (backwards`if`) closes the if statment

This outputs nothing because `docs` is a directory not a file. 

If we switch it, we get output: 

```
if test -f API.md; then echo "file"; fi 
```

```
file
```

We can put the if inside of the loop. 

```
for file in $(ls); do if test -f $file;  echo $file; fi; done
```

```
bash: syntax error near unexpected token `fi'
```

I forgot the `then` so bash said it had bad syntax around `fi` this is because it was treating everything after the `if` as the condition and looking for a `then` but when it got to `fi` it knew it was too late and the `then` was not coming because the `fi` is supposed to be after `then`. 

Once we put `then` in, it works: 

```
for file in $(ls); do if test -f $file;then  echo $file; fi; done
```

```

```

## Script files 

We can put our script into a file 

```
nano filecheck.sh 
```

So that the file 
```
for file in $(ls)
do 
  if test -f $file
  then
     echo $file
  fi
done
```

and run it with `bash <filename>`

```
bash filecheck.sh 
```

```

abstract_base_class.py
alternative_classes.py
filecheck.sh

```


```
cat filecheck.sh 
```

```
for file in $(ls)
do 
  if test -f $file
  then
     echo $file
  fi
done
```

## `gh` CLI operations 

When you are working sometimes it is helpful to be able to manipulate (or create) issues, pull requests or even releases from the command line. 
````{margin}
```{note}
This is how I post announcements. I work on the notes (a markdown file) in vs code and then I use the vscode terminal to commit, push, create a tag, and create a release. I can post the notes and notify you all that they are posted without leaving VScode at all; this makes it much simpler/faster than it would be using Brightspace

We can also search and filter them by piping the output to `grep` which searches the **contents** of a file (including stdin). We previously searched the file **names** with `find`.  So `find` searches the paths that exist and `grep` actually reads the contents of the files, it does so faster than many other languages would be. 

```
gh issue list -s all | grep "Create"
```

## Badge Hints 

```{important}
The goal is to put files in your kwl repo for us to review, that summarizes the *contributions* you have done in your group repo
```



- See the options for `gh pr list`. 
- Use two strategies for what you are the author and when you are the reviewer
- Try the json option on `gh pr list` and see how it can help you
- I use bash in the your experience badge action to make a file with a date in the file name
- You can run a file from different locations


```
cd ../test
bash ../github-in-class-brownsarahm-1/filecheck.sh 
```

```
new.txt
test.txt
```


```
cd ../../
bash systems/github-in-class-brownsarahm-1/filecheck.sh 
```

```
```


```
ls

## Experience Report Evidence

## Questions After Today's Class 

### Is there any structure/tools to reverse the order of if and do in a bash loop? Writing "do if" doesn't feel natural to me.

The `do` is a part of the `for`. We put the `if` in the loop body, as the first thing in there. It could have been like


```
for file in $(ls)
do 
  echo checking $file
  if test -f $file
  then
     echo $file is a file
  fi
done
```

### Would the script that we wrote into the file still work with semicolons or would adding them ruin the syntax?

This is easily testable.  

### How come we have been using git commands in stead of gh commands?

`git` commands are the core things we have been learning about so that you can use `git` no matter what host you use.  `gh` commands **only** work with GitHub.  They will not work on BitBucket, Gitlab, or any other git host. GitHub is popular, but since Microsoft purcahsed it, some people have left because they do not trust Microsoft.  

### What else can we use this gh command for?

Its most important uses are for issues and pull requests 

### What does the $ mean since it's used in so many places?

It is the syntax for using a value from a variable. 

### Are the API.MD, CONTRIBUTING.MD ...etc files important? They have disappeared from my main branch

No, but I do encourage you to try to get them back. Try using `git log` to see what might have happened. 

### Can the script be in any type of file or does it have to be in a certain type of file?

They must be in plain text but the file extension does not matter. 

### How is this you said fi is the oppisite if but in a contect in a if else statement what do it do? (like else if).

### Is there any major benefit in creating an issue in a repo directly within a terminal, or is it just a matter of preference?

I use the terminal within vscode to make issues sometimes while I am working on onet thing but I get an idea for a future feature. Using the terminal is helpful because I don't always have the GitHub web page for thta repo open while I am working, but I do alwasy have a terminal in the folder where I'm working.  So I can quickly take note of an idea and then get back to what I was doing. Less switching contexts helps stay focused and complete tasks faster. 

### How often would I use bash programming as a software engineer?

For small bits here and there. You might not write bash scripts often but when you do it will be thing sthat could save you a ton of time.  
A lot of build processes are bash scripts, as we will see soon. 

You will most likely never write a large program in bash, but you will almost definitely write or update small bash scripts on a semi-regular basis.  

### can you create classes and objects in bash?

No bash is not an object oriented language

### what are the benefits, if any, to bash scripting in the terminal rather then in an IDE? 

knowing how to do to it is important becuse sometimes an IDE is not available.  On a regular basis though no difference. 

### What exactly does grep do, can it only be used with piping?

grep searches files.  We'll come back to it.  It can search the contents of any file, not only stdin
