Today we will talk about documentation, there are several reasons this is important: 
- **using** official documentation is the best way to get better at the tools
- understanding how documentation is designed and built will help you use it better
- **writing** and  **maintaining** documentation is really important part of working on a team
- documentation building tools are a type of developer tool (and these are generally good software design)
---


In particular documentation tools are really good examples of: 
- pattern matching
- modularity
- automation
- building 

*conceptual topics*
---

By the end of today's class you will be able to:
- describe different types of documentation
- find different information in a code repo
- generate documentation as html 
- ignore content from a repo
- create a repo locally and push to GitHub

*practical skills*

## What is documentation 

[documentation types table](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10606-018-9333-1/tables/1)

from [ethnography of docuemtnation data science](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10606-018-9333-1)



### Why is documentation so important?

we should probably spend more time on it

![differenc ein time spent vs should](https://media.springernature.com/full/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10606-018-9333-1/MediaObjects/10606_2018_9333_Fig4_HTML.png?as=webp)

[source](https://bids.berkeley.edu/news/most-developers-think-we-should-spend-more-time-documentation)


## So, how do we do it? 

[Documenation Tools](https://docathon.github.io/docathon/pages/resources.html#documentation-tools)



[write the docs](https://www.writethedocs.org/)

[linux kernel uses sphinx](https://lwn.net/Articles/705224/) and here is [why](https://lwn.net/Articles/692704/) and [how it works](https://lwn.net/Articles/692705/)


## Jupyterbook 

[Jupyterbook](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html) wraps sphinx and uses markdown instead of restructured text. We're goign to use this. 

```
jupyter-book create tiny-book
```

```

===============================================================================

Your book template can be found at

    tiny-book/

===============================================================================

```
jupyter-book create example

ls -a
```

```

..			logo.png		references.bib
_config.yml		markdown-notebooks.md	requirements.txt
_toc.yml		markdown.md
```

### starting a git repo locally 



```
git init .
```

```
hint: Using 'master' as the name for the initial branch. This default branch name
hint: is subject to change. To configure the initial branch name to use in all
hint: of your new repositories, which will suppress this warning, call:
hint: 
hint: 	git config --global init.defaultBranch <name>
hint: 
hint: Names commonly chosen instead of 'master' are 'main', 'trunk' and
hint: 'development'. The just-created branch can be renamed via this command:
hint: 
hint: 	git branch -m <name>
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/brownsarahm/Documents/inclass/systems/tiny-book/.git/
```
Here we are faced with a social aspect of computing that is *also* a good reminder about how git actually works 


Historically the default brancht was called master.

- [derived from a master/slave analogy](https://mail.gnome.org/archives/desktop-devel-list/2019-May/msg00066.html) which is not even how git works, but was adopted terminology from other projects
- [GitHub no longer does](https://github.com/github/renaming)
- [the broader community is changing as well](https://sfconservancy.org/news/2020/jun/23/gitbranchname/)
- [git allows you to make your default not be master](https://lore.kernel.org/git/pull.656.v4.git.1593009996.gitgitgadget@gmail.com/)
- [literally the person who chose the names "master" and "origin" regrets that choice](https://twitter.com/xpasky/status/1271477451756056577) the name main is a more accurate and not harmful term and the current convention.  



we'll change our default branch to main
```
git branch -m main
```

```
```


```
git status
```

```
On branch main

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

and we will commit the template.
```
git add .

### Strucutre of a Jupyter book
```
ls
```

```
_config.yml		logo.png		notebooks.ipynb
_toc.yml		markdown-notebooks.md	references.bib
intro.md		markdown.md		requirements.txt
```

A jupyter book has two required files (`_config.yml` and `_toc.yml`)

- [config defaults](https://jupyterbook.org/customize/config.html#configuration-defaults)
- [toc file formatting rules](https://jupyterbook.org/structure/toc.html#structure-of-a-book)


Some files contain the content. 
The other files are optional, but common. [Requirements.txt](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#requirements-files) is the format for pip to install python depndencies. There are different standards in other languages for how


the extention (`.yml`) is [yaml](https://yaml.org/), which stands for "YAML Ain't Markup Language". It consists of key, value pairs and is deigned to be a human-friendly way to encode data for use in any programming language.

```{admonition} Further Reading
bibliographies are generated with [bibtex](http://www.bibtex.org/) which takes structured information from the references in a [bibtex file](http://www.bibtex.org/Format/) with help from [sphinxcontrib-bibtex](https://sphinxcontrib-bibtex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

For general reference, reference managers like [zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) and [mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/) can track all of your sources and output the references in bibtex format that you can use anywhere or sync with tools like MS Word or Google Docs. 
```


```
cat _config.yml 
```

```yaml
# Book settings
# Learn more at https://jupyterbook.org/customize/config.html

  url: https://github.com/executablebooks/jupyter-book  # Online location of your book
  path_to_book: docs  # Optional path to your book, relative to the repository root

# Add GitHub buttons to your book
# See https://jupyterbook.org/customize/config.html#add-a-link-to-your-repository
html:
  use_issues_button: true
  use_repository_button: true
```
The configuration file, tells it basic iformation about the book, it provides all of the settings that jupyterbook and sphinx need to render the content as whatever output format we want.

The table of contents file describe how to put the other files in order.
```
cat _toc.yml

```{admonition} Try it yourself
Which files created by the template are not included in the rendered output? How could you tell?
```


```
ls
```

```
_build			logo.png		references.bib
_config.yml		markdown-notebooks.md	requirements.txt
_toc.yml		markdown.md
intro.md		notebooks.ipynb
```


```
ls _build/
```

```
html		jupyter_execute
```


```
ls _build/html/
```

```
_sources		index.html		notebooks.html
_sphinx_design_static	intro.html		objects.inv
_static			markdown-notebooks.html	search.html
genindex.html		markdown.html		searchindex.js
```
We didn't have to write any html and we got a responsive site!

If you wanted to change the styling with sphinx you can use built in
[themes](https://sphinx-themes.org/) which tell sphinx to put different
files in the `_static` folder when it builds your site, but you don't have to change any of your content!  If you like working on front end things (which is great! it's just not alwasy the goal) you can even
build [your own theme](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/development/theming.html) that can work with sphinx.

## Ignoring Built files

```
git status
```

```
On branch main
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	_build/

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

We do not want to keep track of changes for the built files since they are generated from the source files. It's redundant and makes it less clear where someone should update content. 

Git helps us with this with the .gitignore

```
echo "_build" >> .gitignore
```


```
git status
```

```
On branch main
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	.gitignore

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```
now that's the only new file as far as git is concerned, so we will track this, 

```
git add .
```



```
git commit -m "ignore build"
```

```
[main be4ae7c] ignore build
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 .gitignore
```


## How do I push a repo that I made locally to GitHub

For today, create an [ empty github repo shared with me](https://classroom.github.com/a/dMQtKjvV).

More generally, you can [create a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo)

That default page for an empty repo if you do not initiate it with any files will give you the instructions for what remote to add.

```
git remote add origin https://github.com/introcompsys/tiny-book-brownsarahm-1.git
```

We can see what it did

```
git remote
```

```
origin
```


```
git status
```

```
On branch main
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```


```
git push -u origin main
```

## Questions After Today's Class 

### How does the jupyter-book automatically translate html?

It runs a parser on the markdown and adds those into templates based on the settings.  
Markdown is designed to be translated to HTML. Working with templates is like at the 
file level, but similar to using string formatting in programming([C++](https://cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/printf/), [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#fancier-output-formatting),
[javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals), [Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/)). 

**more in depth exploration here is a good explore badge**

### what is a .yml file?

Be sure to read the questions after every class, this has been [asked and answered](yamldeffaq). I also added {term}`yml` to the glossary. 


### Is it a good habit to pretty much git status every other line just to keep track of where I am at?

Until you are confident at keeping track of it in your head, yes.  I will continue to do it a little bit more than I do when I'm working in class, but even when I am working, I use it a lot.  It is also good to get confirmation that git is where you think it is. 

###  Is there a cheatsheet for jupyter-book or just the documentation?

The documentation's `RESOURCES` section has a [cheatsheet](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/reference/cheatsheet.html) for Myst-Markdown and a [configuration reference](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/customize/config.html) which are what I use a lot. 

### What is the difference between Jupyter Book, Lab, and Notebook?

Jupyter Notebook is a single stream of computational analysis. Jupyter Lab is a more IDE like interface for doing compuational analyses. Both are part of [project jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) and [on GitHub](https://github.com/jupyter)

[Jupyter book](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html) is for publishing book like documents as websites and to other forms designed to be compatible with jupyter notebooks, but is a part of a separate [executable books](https://github.com/executablebooks) project.  It is specialized for cases where there is computation in the code.  See [their gallery]() for examples.  I use it for [CSC310 that has code and plots in the notes](https://rhodyprog4ds.github.io/BrownFall22/notes/2022-09-21.html)

### Is documentation a requirement when creating a programming language?

If you want people to be able to use your language then pretty much. That said, not all languages are open source and have easily accessbile, official documentation.  [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/), [Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/index.html), [Asteroid](https://asteroid-lang.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (developed here at URI), [Ruby](https://ruby-doc.org/) and [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/users/documentation/) among many others do. On the other hand the C++ language does not have any official documentation. There is a [C++ standard](https://isocpp.org/std/the-standard) that you can purchase, but no official documentation. 

### Can jupyterbook convert other languages to html or only python?

It doesn't convert plain python to html, it can run jupyter notebooks.  Jupyter notebooks can run [many different](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels) [kernels](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/glossary.html#term-kernel). [Jupyter-book is an opinionated distribution](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/explain/sphinx.html#:~:text=opinionated%20distribution%20of%20Sphinx) of  [sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/) which can also be used to document other languages like [C++](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/clear-functional-c-documentation-with-sphinx-breathe-doxygen-cmake/)

### this seemed like a tedious way of creating a repository is there maybe a shorter way?

The only thing that was for making the repository was the `git init .` step and then to link to GitHub, 
`git remote add`. 

### Should I use Jupyterbook for creating websites showcasing some of my programming projects?

You totally can. You could also use sphinx which is more customizable. A [sphinx gallery](https://sphinx-gallery.github.io/stable/index.html) might be of interest. 

```{admonition} Build Badge
:class: anchor

You could build a profile website using a tool like this or other jamstack tool that showcases projects for a build badge. 
```

### What happends to files in .gitignore once the repo is pushed?

Absolutely nothing. They exist in your working directory but they are not in the `.git` directory.  These files are not tracked by git locally and not backed up by being copied to a server.
