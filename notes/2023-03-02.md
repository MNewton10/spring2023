# How do git references work?

```{important}
This picks up directly from where we left off in: [](2023-02-23.md)

```

We start in the `test` repo: 

```
cd test
ls -a
```

```
.		..		.git		test.txt
```
We have one file, `test.txt`, but we were working more inside the `.git` directory. 


Remember: git objects

```{mermaid}

classDiagram
    class tree{
    List: 
      - hash: blob
      - string: type
      - string:file name 
    }
    class commit{
        hash: parent
        hash: tree
        string: message
        string: author 
        string: time
    }
    class blob{
        binary: contents
    }
    class object{
        hash: name

    }
    object <|-- blob
    object <|-- tree
    object <|-- commit
```
There are 3 types:
- blob objects: the content of your files (data)
- tree objects: stores file names and groups files together (organization)
- Commit Objects: stores information about the sha values of the snapshots


Recall the `.git` directory has many other files in it.
```
ls .git
```

```
HEAD		description	index		objects
config		hooks		info		refs
```


## What does git status do? 

_compares the working directory to the current state of the active branch_


- we cansee the working directory with: `ls`
- we can see the active branch in the `HEAD` file 
- what is its status? 




```
git status
```

```
On branch main

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   test.txt

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   test.txt

```


we see it is "on main" this is because we set the branch to main , but since we have not written there, we have to do it directly. Notice that when we use the porcelain command for commit, it does this automatically; the porcelain commands do many things.

In our case because we made the commit manually, we did not update the branch, so it says we have no commits..  

Notice, we have no commits yet even though we had written a commit.  This is because the main branch does not point to any commit.

We can verify by looking at the `HEAD` file

```
cat .git/HEAD
```

```
ref: refs/heads/main
```

and then viewing that file
```
cat .git/refs/heads/main
```

```
cat: .git/refs/heads/main: No such file or directory
```
which does not even exist!

```
ls .git/refs/heads
```

```
```
nothing exists there yet!

```
ls .git/refs
```

```
heads	tags
```

we can see the objects though: 

```
find .git/objects/ -type f
```

```
.git/objects//0c/1e7391ca4e59584f8b773ecdbbb9467eba1547
.git/objects//d6/70460b4b4aece5915caf5c68d12f560a9fe3e4
.git/objects//d8/329fc1cc938780ffdd9f94e0d364e0ea74f579
.git/objects//18/8a75ef66b6a85be0ab68d8575ec27808881dfc
.git/objects//4b/825dc642cb6eb9a060e54bf8d69288fbee4904
.git/objects//83/baae61804e65cc73a7201a7252750c76066a30
```


```
git cat-file -t 188a
```

```
commit
```

This is our repo currently, but the branches are not there!
```{mermaid}
classDiagram
    class d67046{
        test content
        (blob)
    }
    class 83baae{
        Version 1
        (blob)
    }
    class 4b825d{
        (tree)
    }
    class d8329f{
        blob: 83baae
        filename: test.txt
        (tree)
    }
    class 0c1e73{
        Version 1
        Verson 2
        (blob)
    }
    class 188a75{
        tree d8329f
        author name
        commiter time
    }
    d8329f --|> 83baae
    188a75 --|> d8329f
```


## Git References

---



```
echo 188a75ef66b6a85be0ab68d8575ec27808881dfc > .git/refs/heads/main
```

```
```


```
git status
```

```
On branch main
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   test.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```


We can see that indeed we have one object that is a commit



```
git cat-file -p 188a
```

```
tree d8329fc1cc938780ffdd9f94e0d364e0ea74f579
author Sarah M Brown <brownsarahm@uri.edu> 1677177139 -0500
committer Sarah M Brown <brownsarahm@uri.edu> 1677177139 -0500

first commit
```


```
git cat-file -p d8329
```

```
100644 blob 83baae61804e65cc73a7201a7252750c76066a30	test.txt
```



```
git cat-file -p 83baa
```

```
version 1
```
So we now have HEAD-> main and main -> our commit -> tree --> blob. 

## Making another commit

First lets find the hash for the version 2 of test.txt

```
find .git/objects/ -type f
```

```
.git/objects//0c/1e7391ca4e59584f8b773ecdbbb9467eba1547
.git/objects//d6/70460b4b4aece5915caf5c68d12f560a9fe3e4
.git/objects//d8/329fc1cc938780ffdd9f94e0d364e0ea74f579
.git/objects//18/8a75ef66b6a85be0ab68d8575ec27808881dfc
.git/objects//4b/825dc642cb6eb9a060e54bf8d69288fbee4904
.git/objects//83/baae61804e65cc73a7201a7252750c76066a30
```

We can display objects to see that it is what we want. 

```
git cat-file -p 0c1e
```

```
version 1
version 2
```

Then we add it to the index
````{margin}
```{tip}
Review the previous class if this part is confusing
```
````

```
git update-index --add --cacheinfo 100644 \
 0c1e7391ca4e59584f8b773ecdbbb9467eba1547 test.txt
```

Let's also add a second file
```
echo "new file" > new.txt 
```

and hash that and write it to the repo


```
git hash-object -w new.txt
```

```
fa49b077972391ad58037050f2a75f74e3671e92
```
and stage it as well

```
git update-index --add --cacheinfo 100644 \
>  fa49b077972391ad58037050f2a75f74e3671e92 new.txt
```

Now we have two files stages: 

```
git status
```

```
On branch main
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   new.txt
	modified:   test.txt

```
and in our repo

```
ls
```

```
new.txt		test.txt
```

Now we will write a tree object from all of the staged things: 

```
git write-tree
```

```
163b45f0a0925b0655da232ea8a4188ccec615f5
```

and make a second comit. 

```
echo "second commit" | git commit-tree 163b -p 188a
```

This command:
- `echo` sends "second commit" to stdout
- the pipe `|` connects that std out to stdin of the next command
- `git commit-tree` needs a tree (`163b`) as its input
- the `-p` option specifies the parent which is in this case our previous commit (mines is `188a`)

```
90f8d145f3b264e99832b47a662ed5d50b687e7a
```
and it returns the commit hash, which as with the first comit is unique to each of us. 

```
git status
```

```
On branch main
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   new.txt
	modified:   test.txt

```

THen we can set our main branch to point to the new commit so that it will see what we expect

```
git update-ref refs/heads/main 90f8
```

and we can also use `git log` now

```
git log
```

```
commit 90f8d145f3b264e99832b47a662ed5d50b687e7a (HEAD -> main)
Author: Sarah M Brown <brownsarahm@uri.edu>
Date:   Thu Mar 2 13:15:39 2023 -0500

    second commit

commit 188a75ef66b6a85be0ab68d8575ec27808881dfc

    first commit
```

## What does all this get me? 

We can create a new branch at a previous point: 

```
git update-ref refs/heads/test 188a
```

```
git log
```

```
commit 90f8d145f3b264e99832b47a662ed5d50b687e7a (HEAD -> main)
Author: Sarah M Brown <brownsarahm@uri.edu>
Date:   Thu Mar 2 13:15:39 2023 -0500

    second commit

commit 188a75ef66b6a85be0ab68d8575ec27808881dfc (test)
Author: Sarah M Brown <brownsarahm@uri.edu>
Date:   Thu Feb 23 13:32:19 2023 -0500

    first commit
```

We see the file for each branch points to the commit

```
cat .git/refs/heads/test
```

```
188a75ef66b6a85be0ab68d8575ec27808881dfc
```

We can change them around as we like:


```
git update-ref refs/heads/main 188a
```



```
git log
```

```
commit 188a75ef66b6a85be0ab68d8575ec27808881dfc (HEAD -> main, test)
Author: Sarah M Brown <brownsarahm@uri.edu>
Date:   Thu Feb 23 13:32:19 2023 -0500

    first commit
```

This does not lose any of our data, it just makes it harder to access, we have to know the hashes of thigns to find them if we did not have the branch structure to traverse the structure. 

 We can put this back 

```
git update-ref refs/heads/main 90f8
git log
```

```
commit 90f8d145f3b264e99832b47a662ed5d50b687e7a (HEAD -> main)
Author: Sarah M Brown <brownsarahm@uri.edu>
Date:   Thu Mar 2 13:15:39 2023 -0500

    second commit

commit 188a75ef66b6a85be0ab68d8575ec27808881dfc (test)
Author: Sarah M Brown <brownsarahm@uri.edu>
Date:   Thu Feb 23 13:32:19 2023 -0500

    first commit
```

and see that the files are as expected: 
```
ls
```

```
new.txt		test.txt
```


```
git status
```

```
On branch main
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

### We can checkout any commit, not jsut branches

```
git checkout 188a
```

```
Note: switching to '188a'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

  git switch -c <new-branch-name>

Or undo this operation with:

  git switch -

Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false

HEAD is now at 188a75e first commit
```


```
cat .git/HEAD 
```

```
188a75ef66b6a85be0ab68d8575ec27808881dfc
```
This changes the head pointer directly to the commit. 

```
ls
```

```
test.txt
```
and checkout also updates the working directory

```
cat test.txt 
```

```
version 1
```


```
git checkout test
```

```
Switched to branch 'test'
```


```
ls
```

```
test.txt
```


```
cat test.txt 
```

```
version 1
```
## What does this mean? 

We tend to think of comits like this: 

```{mermaid}
flowchart RL
subgraph A[first commit]
%% commitA
file1v1
%% treeA
%% blob1
end 
subgraph B[second commit]
file1v2
file2v1
file3v1
%% commitB
%% treeB
%% blob2
end
B--> A
```

In reality 


```
flowchart RL
subgraph A[first commit]
commitA
%% file1v1
treeA
blob1
commitA-->treeA
treeA-->blob1
end 
subgraph B[second commit]
%% file1v2
%% file2v1
%% file3v1
commitB
treeB
blob1v2
blob2
blob3
commitB-->treeB
treeB-->blob1v2
treeB--->blob2
treeB-->blob3
end
%% B--> A
commitB -->commitA
```


## We can move pointers around freely


```
flowchart BT
blob1
blob2
blob3
subgraph A[first commit]
    direction TB
    commitA
    %% file1v1
    treeA
    commitA-->treeA

end 
subgraph B[second commit]
    direction TB
    %% file1v2
    %% file2v1
    %% file3v1
    commitB
    treeB
    commitB-->treeB
end
%% subgraph C[third commit]
%%     direction TB
%%     %% file1v2
%%     %% file2v1
%%     %% file3v1
%%     commitC
%%     commitC-->treeC
%% end
B--> A

%% treeC-->blob1
treeC--->blob2
treeC-->blob3
treeB-->blob1
treeB--->blob2
treeA-->blob1
commitB -->commitA
commitC-->commitB
treeA ~~~ treeB
treeB ~~~treeC
main --> commitA
branchB --> commitB
branchC --> commitC2
subgraph C2[new commit]
commitC2 -->treeC
commitC2 -->commitA

    treeC
end

%% A ~~~blob1
%% B ~~~blob2
%% C ~~~blob3
```
