## Questions After Today's Class 

### Questions we will answer next class 

- How do changes that I do to the repo offline update on the github website?
- Does github connect to a file automatically or do i have to connect it manual
- What other command options/flag examples like ls -a?
- When we make changes to our cloned repository, do we need to make commits/pull requests within gitbash, or the equivalent, in order for the changes to showup on the browser github?

### Questions I need clarification from you to be able to answer

__probably go to office hours__

- I would like more clarification on how to navigate the experience reflection badge.
- Why is nothing working lol. I tried downloading the github thing from the command line and nothing worked
- After downloading homebrew, the "gh auth login" still doesn't work. 


### Why is SSH less secure than the HTTPS standard?

SSH keys are secure, but other shell things are not.  Using SSH keys is acutally preferred, but you cannot do other types of command line password operations with GitHub.  git alone, does support HTTPS connection with passwords, but GitHub no longer does.  It only allows you to use PAT (a temporary password), SSH keys, or using the GitHub CLI tool to use your browser.  We will use SSH keys later. 

### Why would we want to create files from Git Bash terminal as opposed to File Explorer or CMD Prompt

bash is not operating specific, so using bash commands can work on more systems including most servers, while CMD commands can only work on Windows (and basically no servers).  File explorer is fine one file at a time, but you cannot automate it. 

### How do you move folders into other folders in terminal once you've created them?

The `mv` command does this. [see its documentation](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/mv.1.html) 

### Is there an easy way to remember shortcuts for terminal?

Lots of practice. 

### is GitHub desktop used less often than git via command line?

I would say yes for a few reasons: 
- I think only novices and nonprogrammers use GitHub desktop extensively.
- It has fewer features. 
- It's not typically avialable on a server. 
- It only works with GitHub, not other servers

The GitHub specific CLI, I do not have a good sense of how often it is used.
