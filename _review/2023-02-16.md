1. Make your kwl repo into a jupyter book. Review the notes carefully for what files are required to make `jupyter-book build` run.  Ignore your build directory. 
2. Add `docs.md` to your KWL repo and explain the most important things to know about documentation in your own words using other programming concepts you have learned so far.  Include in a markdown (same as HTML `<!-- comment -->` ) comment the list of CSC courses you have taken for context while we give you feedback.
3. Learn about the documentation ecosystem in a language that you know besides Python. In `docs.md` include a summary of your findings and compare and contrast it to jupyter book/sphinx.  Include a [bibliography](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/content/citations.html) of the sources you used. You can use [this generator](https://url-to-bibtex.vercel.app/) for informal sources and [google scholar](https://digitalmeasures.oregonstate.edu/training/export-bibtex-google-scholar) for formal sources.
