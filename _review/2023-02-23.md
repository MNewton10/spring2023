1. Make a table in {index}`gitplumbingreview.md` in your KWL repo that relates the two types of git commands we have seen: plubming and porcelain. The table should have two columns, one for each type of commands.  Each row should have one git plumbing command and at least one of the corresponding git porcelain command(s). Include three rows: git add, git commit, and git status.
