1. For 2 languages from the loved vs dreaded list (one top 5; one bottom 5) read 2-3 posts about why people love/hate that language and summarize the key points on each side (meaning pros and cons for both loved and dreaded languges).  Include links to all of the posts you read in a section titled `## Sources` in your markdown file. Make a bulleted list with some notes about the author's background and any limitations that might put on the scope of their opinions. (for example, a data scientists's opinion on languages is very valuable for data science, but less for app development) Add this to your kwl repo in `language_love_dread.md`.
