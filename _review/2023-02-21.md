1. Review the notes
1. Update your kwl chart with what you have learned or new questions
1. Practice with git log and redirects to write the commit history of your main branch for your kwl chart to a file {index}`gitlog.txt` and commit that file to your kwl repo.
1. Read about different workflows in git and describe which one you prefer to work with and why in {index}`favorite_git_workflow.md` in your kwl repo. Two good places to read from are [Git Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Distributed-Git-Distributed-Workflows#ch05-distributed-git) and the [atlassian Docs](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows)
