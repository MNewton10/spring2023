# When do I get an advantage from git and bash? 


so far we have used git and bash to accomplish familiar goals, and git and bash feel like just extra work for familiar goals. 

Today, we will start to see why git and bash are essential skills: they give you efficiency gains and time traveling super powers (within your work, only, sorry)

## Important references 

Use these for checking facts and resources. 

- [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/index.html)
- [git](https://git-scm.com/docs)

## Setup

First, we'll go back to our github inclass folder 
```
cd Documents/inclass/systems/github-in-class-brownsarahm-1/
```

and make sure we are on main: 

```
git status
```

```
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

Then we will use fetch to see if we are really up to date

```
git fetch
```

We will also check for open PRs in the browser:

Note this is optional, and only works with the `gh` cli is installed
```
gh repo view --web
```

```
Opening github.com/introcompsys/github-in-class-brownsarahm-1 in your browser.
```
and merge thm there. 

To get to your main branch. 
```
git checkout main
```

```
Already on 'main'
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.
```
then fetch again because we now **know** there are changes on GitHub

```
git fetch
```

```

From https://github.com/introcompsys/github-in-class-brownsarahm-1
   0169e39..4b89dff  main       -> origin/main
```


```
ls
```

```
README.md	about.md
```

Notice that it updated the .git, but not our working directory. 
```
cat about.md 
```

```
```

So we can check again
```
git status
```

```
On branch main
Your branch is behind 'origin/main' by 2 commits, and can be fast-forwarded.
  (use "git pull" to update your local branch)

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```
now we see it knows we are behind and tells us how to update

```
git pull
```

```
Updating 0169e39..4b89dff
Fast-forward
 about.md | 1 +
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
```

## Branches review

We can get a list of the branches we have locally
```
git branch
```

```
  2-create-an-about-file
  fill-in-about
* main
```

or see them with their upstream information

```
git branch -vv
```

```
  2-create-an-about-file 57de0cd [origin/2-create-an-about-file] create empty about
  fill-in-about          c28b4ad [origin/fill-in-about] add my name
* main                   4b89dff [origin/main] Merge pull request #5 from introcompsys/fill-in-about
```

### Different ways to create a branch and switch

This doesn't work for a branch that does not exist
```
git checkout my_branch_checkedout
```

```
error: pathspec 'my_branch_checkedout' did not match any file(s) known to git
```


This creates and switches to. 

```
git checkout -b my_branch_checkedoutb
```

```
Switched to a new branch 'my_branch_checkedoutb'
```

we'll go back to main before the next step
```
git checkout main
```

```
Switched to branch 'main'
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.
```

this is not a real command
```
git branch create my_branch_created
```

```
fatal: not a valid object name: 'my_branch_created'
```


This is a 2 step way to create and switch. 
```
git branch my_branch; git checkout my_branch
```

```
Switched to branch 'my_branch'
```
## Organizing a project (workign with files)

A common question is about how to organize projects.  While our main focus
in this class session is the `bash` commands to do it, the _task_ that we are
going to do is to organize a hypothetical python project

We'll go back to main first
```
git checkout main
```

```
Switched to branch 'main'
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.
```
then create a new branch from main.

```
git checkout -b organization
```

```
Switched to a new branch 'organization'
```


```
touch abstract_base_class.py helper_functions.py important_classes.py alternative_classes.py README.md LICENSE.md CONTRIBUTING.md setup.py tests_abc.py test_help.py test_imp.py test_alt.py overview.md API.md _config.yml
```

```
```


```
git status
```

```
On branch organization
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	API.md

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

## Files, Redirects, git restore

```
cat README.md 
```

```
# GitHub Practice

Name: Sarah Brown
```

Echo allows us to send a message to std out. which is a special file. 

```
echo "age=35"
```

```
age=35
```

We can add contents to files with `echo` and `>>`

```
echo "age=35" >> README.md 
```

Then we check the contents of the file and we see that the new content is there. 
```
cat README.md 
```

```
# GitHub Practice

Name: Sarah Brown
age=35
```

We can redirect other commands too: 

```
git status >> curgit
```

we see this created a new file
```
ls
```

```
API.md			abstract_base_class.py	setup.py
CONTRIBUTING.md		alternative_classes.py	test_alt.py
LICENSE.md		curgit			test_help.py
README.md		helper_functions.py	test_imp.py
_config.yml		important_classes.py	tests_abc.py
about.md		overview.md
```

and we can look at its contents too
```
cat curgit 
```

```
On branch organization
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   README.md

Untracked files:

	important_classes.py
	overview.md
	setup.py
	test_alt.py
	test_help.py
	test_imp.py
	tests_abc.py

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```


```
rm curgit 
```
we'll delete this test file. 


Now we have made some changes we want, so let's commit our changes.  

```
git commit -m 'start organizing'
```

```
On branch organization
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   README.md

	test_imp.py
	tests_abc.py

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```
Without adding first, git cannot make a commit. 


So we will add first then commit. 
```
git add .
git commit -m 'start organizing'
```

```

```
git status
```

```
On branch organization
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

Now, let's go back to thinking about redirects. We saw that with two `>>` we appended to the file.  With just *one* what happens? 

```
echo "age=35" > README.md 
```

We check the file now
```
cat README.md 
```

```
age=35
```
It wrote over.  This would be bad, we lost content, but this is what git is for! 

It is *very very* easy to undo work since our last commit.  This is good for time when you have something you have an idea and you do not know if it is going to work, so you mak a commit before you try it. Then you can try it out.  If it doesn't work you can undo and go back to the place where you made the commit. 

To do this, we will first check in with git

```
git status
```

```
On branch organization
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   README.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

Notice that it tells us what to do `(use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)`.  The version of README.md that we broke is in the working directory but not commited to git, so git refers to them as "changes" in the workign directory. 

```
git restore README.md 
```

this command has no output, so we can use git status to check first

```
git status
```

```
On branch organization
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

and it looks like it did before the `>` line. and we can check the file too
```
cat README.md 
```

```

Back how we wanted it! 

Now we will add some text to the readme

```

```

this explains each file a little bit more than the name of it does.
We see there are sort of 5 groups of files:
- about the project/repository
- code that defines a python module
- test code
- documentation
- extra files that "we know" we can delete.

```{note}
using the open quote `"` then you stay inside that until you close it. when you press enter the command does not run until after you close the quotes
```

```
cat README.md

```
ls
```

```
API.md			abstract_base_class.py	test_alt.py
CONTRIBUTING.md		alternative_classes.py	test_help.py
LICENSE.md		helper_functions.py	test_imp.py
README.md		important_classes.py	tests_abc.py
_config.yml		overview.md
about.md		setup.py
```

## Getting organized

First, we'll make a directory
```
mkdir docs
```

next we will move a file there

```
mv overview.md docs/
```

what this does is change the path of the file from `.../github-inclass-brownsarahm-1/overview.md` to `.../github-inclass-brownsarahm-1/docs/overview.md`


This doesn't return anything, but we can see the effect with `ls`
```
ls
```

```
API.md			abstract_base_class.py	test_alt.py
CONTRIBUTING.md		alternative_classes.py	test_help.py
LICENSE.md		docs			test_imp.py
README.md		helper_functions.py	tests_abc.py
_config.yml		important_classes.py
about.md		setup.py
```

We can also use `ls` with a relative or absolute path of a directory to list tht location instead of our current working directory. 
```
ls docs/
```

```
overview.md
```


```
touch _toc.yml
```



### Moving multiple files with patterns


let's look at the list of files again.


```
ls
```

```
API.md			about.md		setup.py
CONTRIBUTING.md		abstract_base_class.py	test_alt.py
LICENSE.md		alternative_classes.py	test_help.py
README.md		docs			test_imp.py
_config.yml		helper_functions.py	tests_abc.py
_toc.yml		important_classes.py
```

We can use the `*` [wildcard operator](https://tldp.org/LDP/GNU-Linux-Tools-Summary/html/x11655.htm) to move all files that match the pattern. We'll start with the two `yml` [(yaml)](https://yaml.org/)
files that are both for the documentation.
```
mv *.yml docs/
```

Again, we confirm it worked by seeing that they are no longer in the working directory.

```
ls
```

```
API.md			abstract_base_class.py	setup.py
CONTRIBUTING.md		alternative_classes.py	test_alt.py
LICENSE.md		docs			test_help.py
README.md		helper_functions.py	test_imp.py
about.md		important_classes.py	tests_abc.py
```

and that they *are* in `docs`

```
ls docs/
```

```
_config.yml	_toc.yml	overview.md
```

We see that most of the test files start with `test_` but one starts with
`tests_`. We could use the pattern `test*.py` to move them all without
conflicting with the directory `tests/` but we also want consistent names.

We can use `mv` to change the name as well. This is because "moving" a file and
is really about changing its path, not actually copying it from one location to
another and the file name is a part of the path.

```
mv tests_abc.py test_abc.py 
```

This changes the path from `.../tests_abc.py` to `.../test_abc.py` to. It is doing the same thing as when we use it to achieve a move, but changing a differnt part of the path. 

```
ls
```

```
API.md			abstract_base_class.py	setup.py
CONTRIBUTING.md		alternative_classes.py	test_abc.py
LICENSE.md		docs			test_alt.py
README.md		helper_functions.py	test_help.py
about.md		important_classes.py	test_imp.py
```

Now we make a new folder: 

```
mkdir tests
```

and move all of the test files there:
````{margin}
```{note}
this is why good file naming is important even if you have not organized the
whole project yet, you can use the good conventions to help yourself later.
```
````

```
mv test_* tests/
```

```
```


```
ls
```

```
API.md			about.md		helper_functions.py
CONTRIBUTING.md		abstract_base_class.py	important_classes.py
LICENSE.md		alternative_classes.py	setup.py
README.md		docs			tests
```




## Recap

Why do I need a terminal
1. replication/automation
1. it's always there and doesn't change  
1. it's faster one you know it (also see above)

```{epigraph}
So, is the shell the feature that interacts with the operating system and then the terminal is the gui that interacts with the shell?
```



```{important}
if your push gets rejected, read the hints, it probably has the answer.  We will
come back to that error though
```



## Review today's class

```{include} ../_review/2023-02-07.md
```



## Prepare for Next Class

```{include} ../_prepare/2023-02-07.md
```



## More Practice

```{include} ../_practice/2023-02-07.md
```



## Experience Report Evidence

Save your history with: 
```
history > activity-2023-02-07.md
```

then append your git status, and the contents of your github-in-class and github-in-class/docs with `--------------` to help visually separat the parts. 

```bash
echo "--------------" >> activity-2023-02-07.md
git status >> activity-2023-02-07.md
echo "--------------" >> activity-2023-02-07.md
ls >> activity-2023-02-07.md
echo "--------------" >> activity-2023-02-07.md
ls docs/ >> activity-2023-02-07.md
```
then edit that file (on terminal, any text editor, or an IDE) to make sure it only includes things from this activity. 


## Questions After Today's Class 

### how would we move every file we have into a new folder

```
mv old_folder/* new_folder/
```

### Can we create a pull request through `bash`?

Strictly speaking `bash` does not do *any* git operations or any GitHub operation, or any other version control operations for other version control systems.  `bash` is a particular scripting language that we are using on our terminal.  We could use a different one, and git can still be used.  

Pull requests are not a git feature, so they are not done by the git program at all. They are done differnt ways for different projects and hosting plan.  For example, the [git source code](https://github.com/git/git) is mirrored (copied) on GitHub, but that is not where they actually do the work of maintaining it. They accept "pull requests" via e-mail. 

### Can we merge using the terminal?

Yes, we will see `git merge` soon. 

### I would like to know more about regular expressions as this is something I have seen but don't really know anything about.

We will use a few examples of them, but we will not go too in depth with them.  We'll focus on the places they can be used and basic regex for the most common cases.  However, this is an *excellent* topic for an explore or build badge. 

### What other symbols can be used to move files like *?

The wildcard `*` can be used not only for moving files, but in lots of places. It is a special character in regular expressions and glob matching.  We will see some different ones, but this is also a good topic for an explore badge. 

### Will we use pipes in the terminal?
Yes, we will see pipes soon. 

### When you said that it only changes file path, do you mean its storage placement in the hard drive stays the same?
Yes, exactly. 

### Will we be learning out to open and use a .py file?

Indirectly.  We will do a tiny bit of editing and running code in python and C, but not too much.  We will learn more about what files are, how they work in general, and the role of interpreters and compilers so that you will be able to use the terminal for any language you encounter. 

### To make sure, mv can rename and move files?

Yes, it can do achieve both of those outcomes, because in the file system they *are the same thing.* "moving a file" does not have to actually copy and rewrite the file in a different part of the hard drive, but instead it changes the path of the file. We typically think about the path as having two parts: the location and the name, but technicall there is a single *path* to the whole file. `mv` can change any part of the path. 

### How can we delete branches?

There is a [delete option on `git branch`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-branch)

### What exactly are we doing with our teams that we were assigned?

Instructions will be given as you need to respond to them, for now just reply to discussions on the team page. 

### Should I start using terminal as a replacement of finder to move files/folders?

If you are comfortable with it.  It will help you get more comfortable faster. 

(yamldeffaq)=
### what is a .yml file?

it is [YAML](https://yaml.org/) which is typically used to store settings and configurations.  GitHub uses it for the workflows, and a lot of other tools I interact with use it for configurations. It stores key-value pairs. 

### Will all the files we used in the terminal today will be on the github website?

After we push them, yes. 

### Is there an official list of all git commands?

[the official git documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs) includes a [list of all commands](https://git-scm.com/docs/git#_git_commands). GitHub also publishes a [cheatsheet in many languages](https://training.github.com/). This [visual cheatsheet](https://ndpsoftware.com/git-cheatsheet.html#loc=index;) is also good.
