<h1>Grading<a class="headerlink" href="#grading" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h1>
<p>This section of the syllabus describes the principles and mechanics of the grading for the course.
The course is designed around your learning so the grading is based on you demonstrating how much
you have learned.</p>
<p>Additionally, since we will be studying programming tools, we will use them to administer
the course. To give you a chance to get used to the tools there will be a grade free zone
for the first few weeks.</p>
<section id="learning-outcomes">
<h2>Learning Outcomes<a class="headerlink" href="#learning-outcomes" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>The goal is for you to learn and the grading is designed to as close as possible actually
align to how much you have learned.  So, the first thing to keep in mind, always is the
course learning outcomes:</p>
<p>By the end of the semester, students will be able to:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Apply common design patterns and abstractions to understand new code bases, tools, and components of systems.</p></li>
<li><p>Differentiate the different classes of tools used in computer science in terms of their features, roles, and how they interact and justify positions and preferences among popular tools</p></li>
<li><p>Identify the computational pipeline from hardware to high level programming language</p></li>
<li><p>Discuss implications of choices across levels of abstraction</p></li>
<li><p>Describe the context under which essential components of computing systems were developed and explain the impact of that context on the systems.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>These are what I will be looking for evidence of to say that you met those or not.</p>
</section>
<section id="principles-of-grading">
<h2>Principles of Grading<a class="headerlink" href="#principles-of-grading" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>Learning happens through practice and feedback. My goal as a teacher is for you to learn.
The grading in this course is designed to reflect how deeply you learn the material, even
if it takes you multiple attempts to truly understand a topic. The topics in this course
are all topics that will come back in later courses, so it is important that you understand
each of them correctly so that it helps in the next course.</p>
<p>This course is designed to encourage you to work steadily at learning the material
and demonstrating your new knowledge. There are no single points of failure, where
you lose points that cannot be recovered. Also, you cannot cram anything one time
and then forget it. The material will build and you have to demonstrate that you
retained material. You will be required to demonstrate understanding of the connections
between ides from different parts of the course.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Earning a C in this class means you have a general understanding; you will know what all the terms mean; you could follow along in a meeting where others were discussing systems concepts and use core tools for common tasks. You know where to start when looking things up.</p></li>
<li><p>Earning a B means that you can apply the course concepts in other programming environments; you can solve basic common errors without looking much up.</p></li>
<li><p>Earning an A means that you can use knowledge from this course to debug tricky scenarios; you can know where to start and can form good hypotheses about why uncommon errors have occurred; you can confidently figure out new complex systems.</p></li>
</ul>
<!-- Earning an A  -->
<p>The course is designed for you to <em>succeed</em> at a level of your choice.  As you accumulate
knowledge, the grading in this course is designed to be cumulative instead of based on
deducting points and averaging. No matter what level of work you choose to engage in, you will be expected
to revise work until it is correct.  The material in this course will all come back in other
300 and 400 level CSC courses, so it is essential that you do not leave this course with
misconceptions, as they will make it harder for you to learn related material later.</p>
<div class="checkin dropdown admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">If you made an error in an assignment what do you need to do? </p>
<p>Read the suggestions and revise the work until it is correct.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section id="penalty-free-zone">
<h2>Penalty-free Zone<a class="headerlink" href="#penalty-free-zone" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>Since learning developer tools is a core learning outcome of the course, we will also use them for all aspects of administering the course. This will help you learn these tools really well and create accountability for getting enough practice with core operations, but it also creates a high stakes situation: even submitting your work requires you understanding the tools. This would not be very fair at the beginning of the semester.</p>
<p>For the first three weeks we will have a low stakes penalty-free zone where we will provide extra help and reminders for how to get feedback on your work. In this period, deadlines are more flexible as well. If work is submitted incorrectly, we will still see it because we will manually go look for all activities. After this zone, we will assume you <em>chose</em> to skip something if we do not see it.</p>
<div class="checkin dropdown admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">What happens if you merged a PR without feedback?</p>
<p>During the Penalty-Free zone, it will still be graded and logged.  After that, we will not see it.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition important">
<p class="admonition-title">Important</p>
<p>If there are terms in the rest of this section that do not make sense while we are in the penalty-free zone, do not panic. This zone exists to help you get familiar with the terms needed.</p>
</div>
<p>During the third week, you will create a course plan where you establish your goals for the course and I make sure that you all understand the requirements to complete your goals.</p>
<div class="checkin dropdown admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">What happens if you’re confused by the grading scheme right now?</p>
<p>Nothing to worry about, we will review it again in week three after you get a chance to build the right habits and learn vocabulary.  We will also give you an activity that helps us to be sure that you understand it at that time.</p>
</div>
<!-- 
## Grade-Free Zone

At the beginning of the course we will have a grade free zone where you practice with both 
course concepts and the tooling and assignment types to get used to expectations.  You will 
get feedback on lots of work and begin your Know, Want to know, Learned (KWL) Chart in this period.
It is important to attempt the work during this period to build good habits, but since there 
is no penalty for it not being right, you should feel free to try even if you are not sure.  

You are still required to participate in class and complete in class activities during this period. 

## Grading Contract

In about the third week you will complete, from a provided template, a grading contract. 
In that you will state what grade you plan to earn in the class and what work you are going 
to do to show that level of competence.  If you complete all of that work to a satisfactory
level, you will get that grade.  The grade free zone is a chance for you to get used to the 
type of feedback in the course and the grading contract template will have example contracts 
for you to use.

Most work will be small, frequent activities so that you get a lot of practice with the tools,
 but for an A you will also do larger, more in depth activities.

All contracts will include maintaining a KWL Chart for the duration of the semester, coming to class prepared, participating in class activities, and  collaborating with peers to maintain reference materials.   -->

<p>These counts assume that the semester goes as planned and that there are 26 available badges of each base type (experience, review, practice).

<div class="admonition important">
<p class="admonition-title">Important</p>
<p>There will be 20 review and practice badges available after the penalty free zone. This means that missing the review and practice badges in the penalty free zone cannot hurt you. However, it does not mean it is a good idea to not attempt them, not attempting them at all will make future badges harder, because reviewing early ideas are important for later ideas.</p>
</div>
<p>You cannot earn both practice and review badges for the same class session, but most practice badge requirements will include the review requirements plus some extra steps.
At the end of the semester, there will be special <em>integrative</em> badge opportunities that have multipliers attached to them. These badges will count for more than one. For example an integrative 2x review badge counts as two review badges.  These badges will be more complex than regular badges and therefore count more.</p>

<p>An experience report is evidence you have completed the activity and reflection questions. The exact form will vary per class, if you are unsure, reach out ASAP to get instructions. These are evaluated only for completeness/ good faith effort.

<h3>Explore Badges<a class="headerlink" href="#explore-badges" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>

<p>You can earn a build badge by:</p>

<section id="community-badges">
<h2>Community Badges<a class="headerlink" href="#community-badges" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>Community badges are awarded for extra community participation. Both programming and learning are most effective in good healthy collaboration.  Since being a good member of our class community helps you learn (and helps others learn better), some collaboration is required in other badges. Some dimensions of community participation can only be done once, for example fixing a typo on the course website, so while it’s valuable, all students cannot contribute to the course community in the same way. To reward these unique contributions, you can earn a community badge.</p>
<p>You can see some ideas as they arise by <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/introcompsys/spring2023/labels/community">issues labeled <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">community</span></code></a>.</p>
<p>Community badges can replace missed experience, review, and practice badges, upgrade a review to a practice badge, or they can be used as an alternate way to earn a + modifier on a D,C,or B (URI doesn’t award A+s, sorry).  Community badges are smaller, so they are not 1:1 replacements for other badges. You can earn a maximum of 14 community badges, generally one per week.  Extra helpful contributions may be awarded 2 community badges, but that does not increase your limit. When you earn them, you can plan how you will use it, but they will only be officially applied to your grade at the end of the semester.  They will automatically be applied in the way that gives you the maximum benefit.</p>
<p>Community Badge values:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>3 community = 1 experience badge</p></li>
<li><p>5 community = 1 review</p></li>
<li><p>7 community = 1 practice.</p></li>
<li><p>5 community badges + 1 review = 1 practice.</p></li>
<li><p>10 community =  + step to a D,C, or B, <strong>note that this is more efficient.</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>You can earn community badges by:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>fixing small issues on the course website (during  only)</p></li>
<li><p>contributing extra terms or reviews to your team repo</p></li>
<li><p>sharing articles and discussing them in the course discussions</p></li>
<li><p>contributing annotated resources the course website</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Some participation in your group repo and a small number of discussions will be required for experience, review, and practice badges. This means that not every single contribution or peer review to your team repo will earn a community badge.</p>
</div>
<p>Example(nonexhaustive) uses:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>22 experience + 17 review + 11 community = C (replace 2 experience, 1 review)</p></li>
<li><p>24 experience + 17 review + 5 community = C (replace 1 review)</p></li>
<li><p>24 experience + 18 review + 10 community = C+ (modifier)</p></li>
<li><p>24 experience + 18 practice + 10 community = B+ (modifier)</p></li>
<li><p>23 experience + 18 practice + 13 community = B+ (modifier, replace 1 experience)</p></li>
<li><p>24 experience + 16 practice + 2 review + 10 community = B  (upgrade 2 review)</p></li>
<li><p>24 experience + 10 review + 10 community + 6 practice + 3 explore + 2 build = A (replace 2 review)</p></li>
<li><p>24 experience + 14 review + 10 community + 4 practice + 3 explore + 2 build = A (upgrade 2 review to practice)</p></li>
<li><p>24 experience + 12 review + 14 community + 4 practice + 3 build =A (replace 2 practice)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These show that community badges can save you work at the end of the semester by reducing the number of practice badges or simplifying badges</p>

<h2><span class="fa fa-gift"></span> Free corrections<a class="headerlink" href="#free-corrections" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>All work must be correct and complete to earn credit. In general, this means that when your work is not correct, we will give you guiding questions and advice so that you can revise the work to be correct. Most of the time asking you questions is the best way to help you learn, but sometimes, especially for small things, showing you a correct example is the best way to help you learn.</p>
<p>Additionally, on rare occasions, a student can submit work that is incorrect or will have down-the-line consquences but does not demonstrate a misunderstanding. For example, in an experience badge, putting text below the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">#</span> </code> line instead of replacing the hint within the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;</span> <span class="pre">&gt;</span></code>.  Later, we will do things within the kwl repo that will rely on the title line being filled in, but it’s not a big revision where the student needs to rethink about what they submitted.</p>

<p>If you miss class, the experience report should be at least attempted/drafted (though you may not get feedback/confirmation) before the next class that you attend. This is strict, not as punishment, but to ensure that you are able to participate in the next class that you attend. Skipping the experience report for a missed class, may result in needing to do an experience report for the next class you attend to make up what you were not able to complete due to the missing class activities.</p>
<p>If you miss multiple classes, create a catch-up plan to get back on track by contacting Dr. Brown.</p>

<span id="id2"></span><h3>Review and Practice Badges<a class="headerlink" href="#rp-status" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>These badges have 5 stages:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>posted: tasks are on the course website</p></li>
<li><p>planned: an issue is created</p></li>
<li><p>started: one task is attempted and a draft PR is open</p></li>
<li><p>completed: all tasks are attempted PR is ready for review, and a review is requested</p></li>
<li><p>earned: PR is approved (by instructor or a TA) and work is merged</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="admonition-title">Tip</p>
<p>these badges <em>should</em> be reviewed and started before the next class. This will set you up to make the most out of each class session. However, only prepare for class tasks have to be done immediately.</p>
</div>
<p>These badges badges must be <em>started</em> within one week of when the are posted and <em>completed</em> within two weeks. A task is attempted when you have answered the questions or submitted evidence of doing an activity or asked a sincere clarifying question.</p>
<p>If a badge is planned, but not started within one week it will become expired and ineligble to be earned. You may request extensions to complete a badge by updating the PR message, these will typically be granted. Extensions for starting badges will only be granted in exceptional circumstances.</p>
<p>Once you have a good-faith attempt at a complete badge, you have until the end of the semester to finish the revisions in order to <em>earn</em> the badge.</p>
